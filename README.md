# Troubles opening the Unity project
The Unity project in this repository was made using Unity 2020.3.11f1. If you don't have this exact version, you can still open it using a 2020 Unity version (if you don't have 2020 neither, try with any 2019 or 2021 version).

It is possible that Unity is crashing and showing erros the first time you open the project without Internet. If so, relaunch the project and it should be fine :)

If you still have troubles, ask the supervisor for help
